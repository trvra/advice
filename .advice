You can be funny and kind or funny and cruel. The second one is easier, but the first one is worth it.
Dip the french fry in the Frosty. Go on, try it.
Habit is a powerful force we forget about until it’s turned against us. Be careful which ones you create.
You will remember the most embarrassing crap you do in your life forever and in perfect clarity. Everyone else will remember the kindest things you do. It all comes out in the wash.
If you’re doing a remote podcast, it’s worth it to record audio locally and mix it together. Trust me on this one.
You’re the only one who can let go of your grudges. It’s worth it, I promise. They’re not doing you any good.
Doing the good, brave, kind things can feel silly if you let your internal critic get in the way. Reminder: No one else can hear that guy.
I can count on one hand the number of times putting out negativity has brought me back something worthwhile and even when it works it feels terrible.
Want to be better-liked immediately? Today? Right now? Use people’s names. Ask more questions. Make the person you’re talking to feel important without empty flattery.
Don’t correct people. Unless their wrongness will lead to them getting hurt or hurting someone else. You’ll have a fleeting sense of superiority and they’ll resent you. Nothing worthwhile comes of it. This used to be so hard, but now I cringe when someone else does it.
Cooking a Hot Pocket in the oven may seem counterintuitive, but man, it can really elevate it.
Learning to appreciate things you don’t initially enjoy is the power to fill the world with stuff you like.
Empathy is the final step of maturity. It can take some work, but you’ll be shocked how much easier the world is to navigate when you remember to use it.
You’re probably not drinking enough water.
There’s no narrative to your life, no arc, no reward for achieving all the things you want. That kind of thinking is a recipe for a you-centric world view and is a very lonely road. Focus instead on the role you play in the stories of others. When I was young, there was an old man named Brady at our church who always had gum. No matter what, Brady always had gum that he offered up freely. When he died, it devastated our youth group and I still remember him two decades later. Brady might have only played a bit role in all our life stories, but by playing it with generosity and kindness he achieved a sort of immortality. Putting others first with a cheerful heart isn’t easy, but because of that, even the smallest acts can leave an incalculable impact.
Don’t read the comments. And when you do, only reply to the nice ones
Assume the best.
Give your partner space – early and often.
Give yourself space – early and often.
Your happiness should be enhanced by your partner; not dependent on them.
Think to yourself, ‘Will this matter 24 hours from now?’ and if not, drop it.
No one is a mind reader; if you think something, you should say something before resentment bubbles up. Resentment is silent... and deadly.
Never seek praise. Seek criticism.
Write thank you notes. No one else does it.
Write to your heroes, and tell them what they mean to you.
Don’t be the person on Twitter who scolds other people, or believes snark is an attractive trait. Everything you post on social media is permanent.
So what if the other person doesn’t follow back?
Don’t work for people obsessed about going viral on the Internet.
On time means five minutes early. And then, firm handshakes.
If you get the chance, leave the country for six months.
Be prepared to have your heart broken at least three times.
Exercise the muscle that generates ideas. Ideas are currency.
One-line writing tip: Focus on strong verbs and put your best stuff at the end of a sentence.
Always choose clarity over cleverness.
Invest in yourself. If you can spend $50 a month at a gym, why not take a writing class? A history course? I never knew I loved boxing and painting until I took a class.
Be open to failing, but come out swinging.
Above everything, my God, be grateful.
